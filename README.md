# Material-ish Progress

A material style progress wheel compatible with 2.3

I needed to keep a consistent (or as close as possible) look in an app across all Android Versions. The progress wheel is quite cool in Lollipop, and pretty horrible on Gingerbread.

So I created this. This view uses [Progress Wheel](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/ProgressWheel) as a base, but has been almost completely rewritten (the original view uses handlers for updating the wheel).

This is how it looks:

## Usage

You can create your own progress wheel in xml like this (remeber to add ```xmlns:wheel="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"```):

```xml
<com.pnikosis.materialishprogress.ProgressWheel
        android:id="@+id/progress_wheel"
        android:layout_width="80dp"
        android:layout_height="80dp"
        android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
        android:layout_centerVertical="true"
        wheel:barColor="#5588FF"
        wheel:progressIndeterminate="true" />
```

Or in code:

```Java
ProgressWheel wheel = new ProgressWheel(context);
wheel.setBarColor(Color.BLUE);
...

```

For making the wheel indeterminate, just call the ```spin()``` method. If you set a progress value, the whell will stop spinning.

You have two methods for setting the progress:

```progressWheel.setProgress(float value)```

Sets the value, and the wheel will smoothly animate to that value. The speed of the animation is defined by the spinSpeed (can be set with ```setSpinSpeed```, which number is the number of full turns per second)

```progressWheel.setProgressImmediate(float value)```

Sets the value, and the wheel will instantly move to that value
